Run job_board_scraper.sh in bash
currently requires inputs in the form of phrases.txt and webpages.txt

phrases.txt contains the keywords (case-insensitive) to query for
webpages.txt contains the urls to query for. 

be wary of blank lines 


to do list:
- make optional command line inputs 
- get this to scrape JS objects on websites (which I know nothing about...might take a minute)
