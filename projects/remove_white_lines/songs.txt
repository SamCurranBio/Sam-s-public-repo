G                                                          D

He looked down into her brown eyes and said  Say a prayer for me

                                                         G

She threw her arms around him whispered God will keep us free

                                                           C

They could see the riders coming  He said This is my last fight

                         G                 D            G

If they take me back to Texas  They won't take me back alive


                                       D

There were seven Spanish angels  At the altar of the sun

                                                        G

They were praying for the lovers   In the valley of the gun

                                                                            C

When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared  There was thunder from the throne

                   G             D           G

And seven Spanish angels  Took another angel home


                                                                D

She reached down and picked the gun up  That lay smoking in his hand

                                                              G

She said Father please forgive me  I can't make it without my man

                                                           C

And she knew the gun was empty  And she knew she could not win

                          G                  D            G

But her final prayer was answered  When the rifles fired again



                                          D

There were seven Spanish angels  At the altar of the sun

                                                        G

They were praying for the lovers   In the valley of the gun

                                                                            C

When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared  There was thunder from the throne

                   G             D           G

And seven Spanish angels  Took another angel home




                                                         D

They came and found the lovers as they lay there side by side

                                                          G

Their dreams had all been shattered they said she was his bride

                                                     C

And they laid them by the Altar in the valley of the gun

                          G               D              G

Now their final fight was over and their battle had been won



Chorus:                                               D

There were seven Spanish angels  At the altar of the sun

                                                        G

They were praying for the lovers   In the valley of the gun

                                                                            C

When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared  There was thunder from the throne

                    G            D           G

And seven Spanish angels  Took another angel home

 And it’ still alright 

 
 C       Am         F              C   C  C  C

It ain't alright, the hardness of my head

C              Am       F

Now close your eyes and spin around

     G     C     G         C

Say, hard  times, you could find

But it ain't the way that you  want

                 C    C  C  C

But it's still alright





VERSE:

C       Am         F               C    C  C  C

Late at night, you lay around wondering?

C                Am                 F

Counting all the lines, it ain't so funny now

      G        C         G        C

Say, times are hard, you get this far

       G         C            F   F  F  F

But it ain't the way that you want



G       C         G        C

I'll be damned if this old man

       G       C            F  F  F  F

Don't start to counting his losses

F                 C   C  C  C

But it's still alright





BREAK:

G

They say you learn a lot out there

C

How to scorch and burn

G

Gonna have to bury your friends

C

And then you'll find it gets worse

G

Standing out on the ledge

C

With no way to get down

G                              F   F  F  F

You start praying for wings to grow

I ain't alright, spinning out ahead

It was cold outside when I hit the ground

    G              C        G           C

Say, I could sleep here, forget all the fear

    G              C       F  F  F

But, it would take time to grow

F              C  C  C  C

Maybe, I don't know





C      Am             F         C  C  C  C

Hey, tonight, if you think about it

C                   Am             F

Remembering all the times that you pointed out

          G        C              G        C

Say, the glass is clear, now with all this fear

 G        C        F  F  F  F

Starts a-leaving a mark

G         C         G         C

Your idle hands are all that stands uh

G         C           F  F  F  F

From your time in the dark

                  C

But it's still alright



Have you ever seen the rain 

C

Someone told me long ago

C                                   G

There's a calm before the storm, I know

                  C

It's been coming for some time

When it's over, so they say

C                          G

Coming down on a sunny day

C

Yesterday and days before

C                                G

Sun is cold and rain is hard, I know

Been that way for all my time



C

'Til forever on it goes

C                                    G

Through the circle fast and slow, I know

                  C

It can't stop, I wonder

I wanna know

Piano man
  C      G          F    C
It's nine o'clock on a Saturday

   F       C              D7  G
The regular crowd shuffles in

          C       G       F       C
There's an old man sitting next to me

      F           G         C   G
Making love to his tonic and gin



         C            G         F   C
He says, "Son, can you play me a memory

   F          C           D7   G
I'm not really sure how it goes

        C            G           F          C
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete

    F        G             C
When I wore a younger man's clothes."


[Interlude]
 

Am              D7

Am           D7    G  F C G7
La la, di di da da dum


[Chorus]
 

C         G                F     C
Sing us a song, you're the piano man

F         C      D7   G
Sing us a song tonight

           C          G          F   C
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody

   F                 G         C     G
And you've got us all feeling alright


[Verse 2]
 

   C           G        F         C
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine

  F          C          D7  G
He gets me my drinks for free

        C            G              F             C
And he's quick with a joke and he'll light up your smoke

           F               G           C   G
But there's some place that he'd rather be



         C         G             F       C
He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me."

      F          C            D7  G
As the smile ran away from his face

         C           G          F     C
"Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star

  F           G           C
If I could get out of this place"


[Interlude]
 

Am              D7

Am           D7    G  F C G7
La la, di di da da dum


[Verse 3]
 

   C         G           F   C
Now Paul is a real estate novelist

   F         C          D7  G
Who never had time for a wife

        C            G           F            C
And he's talking with Davy, who's still in the Navy

   F             G      C   G
And probably will be for life



       C           G          F   C
And the waitress is practicing politics

      F           C           D7    G
As the businessman slowly gets stoned

            C         G               F     C
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness

        F           G         C    G
But it's better than drinking alone


[Chorus]
 

C         G                F     C
Sing us a song, you're the piano man

F         C      D7   G
Sing us a song tonight

           C          G          F   C
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody

   F                 G         C     G
And you've got us all feeling alright


[Verse 4]
 

      C           G           F    C
It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday

       F       C          D7    G
And the manager gives me a smile

         C               G               F         C
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see

  F            G           C   G
To forget about life for a while



       C         G             F    C
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival

       F          C             D7  G
And the microphone smells like a beer

        C          G           F           C
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar

         F             G         C     G
And say, "Man, what are you doing here?"


[Interlude]
 

Am              D7

Am           D7    G  F C G7
La la, di di da da dum


[Chorus]

Sing us a song, you're the piano man

F         C      D7   G
Sing us a song tonight

           C          G          F   C
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody

   F                 G         C
And you've got us all feeling alright

Let it go
   Em                      C
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight

     D               Asus4   Am
Not a footprint to be seen

 Em            C
A kingdom of isolation

      D                  Asus4    A
And it looks like I'm the queen

Em            C                 D                 Asus4  Am
  The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside

Em                 D                    A
  Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried


[Pre-Chorus]

D                                      C
  Don't let them in, don't let them see

                                     D
Be the good girl you always have to be

                                    C
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know

              Cadd9
Well, now they know


[Chorus]

      G          D/F#
Let it go, let it go

     Em7             Cadd9
Can't hold it back anymore

      G          D/F#
Let it go, let it go

     Em7              Cadd9
Turn away and slam the door

G         D/F#            Em7        Cadd9
I don't care what they're going to say

       Bm7         Bb
Let the storm rage on

   C
The cold never bothered me anyway

[Verse]

Em                    C              D               Am
  It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small

       Em                 D                Asus4        A
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all


[Pre-Chorus]

D                             Cadd9
  It's time to see what I can do

                            D
To test the limits and break through

                                Cadd9
No right, no wrong, no rules for me


I'm free
 
[Chorus]

      G          D/F#
Let it go, let it go

     Em7                   Cadd9
I am one with the wind and sky

      G          D/F#
Let it go, let it go

      Em7          Cadd9
You'll never see me cry

G      D/F#      Em7       Cadd9
Here I stand and here I'll stay

       Bm7        Bb      C
Let the storm rage on


[Bridge]

C
  My power flurries through the air into the ground

C
  My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around

D
  And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast

Em          C               D              Am     C
  I'm never going back, the past is in the past


[Chorus]

      G          D/F#
Let it go, let it go

        Em7                    Cadd9
And I'll rise like the break of dawn

      G          D/F#
Let it go, let it go

    Em7             Cadd9
That perfect girl is gone

G      D/F#        Em7       Cadd9    Cm
Here I stand in the light of day

       Bm7         Bb
Let the storm rage on

   C
The cold never bothered me anyway


Privateering 
Am
Yon's my privateer, see how trim she lies
 
To every man a lucky hand and to every man a prize
                                  C          G
I live to ride the ocean, the mighty world around
 Am                               G              Am
To take a little plunder and to hear the cannon sound
 
    F               C
To lay with pretty women
                 G        Dsus2
to drink Madeira wine
 Am                                G               Am
to hear the roller's thunder on a shore that isn't mine
 
 
[Chorus]
 
 Am
Privateering, we will go
Privateering, Yoh! oh! ho!
Privateering, we will go
Yeah! oh! oh! ho!
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
 Am
The people on your man o'war are treated worse than scum
 
I'm no flogging Captain, my God I've sailed with some
                                C                G
Come with me to Barbary, we'll ply there up and down
 Am                               G       Am
Not quite exactly in the service of the Crown
 
    F               C
To lay with pretty women
                 G        Dsus2
to drink Madeira wine
 Am                                G               Am
to hear the roller's thunder on a shore that isn't mine

Privateering, we will go
Privateering, Yoh! oh! ho!
Privateering, we will go
Yeah! oh! oh! ho!
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
 Am
Look here there's my privateer, she's small but she can sting
 
Licensed to take prizes with a letter from the King
                                      C             G
I love the streets and taverns of a pretty foreign town
 Am                                       G           Am
tip my hat to the dark eyed ladies as we sally up and down
 
    F               C
To lay with pretty women
                 G        Dsus2
to drink Madeira wine
 Am                                G               Am
to hear the roller's thunder on a shore that isn't mine
 
 
[Chorus]
 
 Am
Privateering, we will go
Privateering, Yoh! oh! ho!
Privateering, we will go
Yeah! oh! oh! ho!
 
 
[Verse 4]
 
 Am
Britannia needs her privateers each time she goes to war
 
Death to all her enemies though prizes matter more
                                C                G
Come with me to Barbary, we'll ply there up and down
 Am                               G       Am
Not quite exactly in the service of the Crown
 
    F               C
To lay with pretty women
                 G        Dsus2
to drink Madeira wine
 Am                                G               Am
to hear the roller's thunder on a shore that isn't mine

Privateering, we will go
Privateering, Yoh! oh! ho!
Privateering, we will go
Yeah! oh! oh! ho!
Chanson de prevert
Am                               C
Oh je voudrais tant que tu te souviennes

F                      C
Cette chanson était la tienne

G                      C
C'était ta préférée je crois

E7                           Am
Qu'elle est de Prévert et Kosma


 
[Chorus]
 

         F                    C
Et chaque fois les feuilles mortes

G                        C
Te rappellent à mon souvenir

          F                 C
Jour après jour les amours mortes

E7                       Am
N'en finissent pas de mourir


 
[Verse 2]
 

Am                              C
Avec d'autres bien sûr je m'abandonne

F                       C
Mais leur chanson est monotone

G                   C
Et peu à peu je m'indiffère

E7                   Am
A cela il n'est rien à faire


 
[Chorus]
 

          F                    C
Car chaque fois les feuilles mortes

G                        C
Te rappellent à mon souvenir

          F                  C
Jour après jour les amours mortes

E7                       Am
N'en finissent pas de mourir


 
[Verse 3]
 

Am                              C
Peut-on jamais savoir par où commence

F                       C
Et quand finit l'indifférence

G                      C
Passe l'automne vienne l'hiver

E7                   Am
Et que la chanson de Prévert


 
[Chorus]
 

         F                   C
Cette chanson les Feuilles Mortes

G                    C
S'efface de mon souvenir

          F                C
Et ce jour là mes amours mortes

E7                Am
En auront fini de mourir

          F                C
Et ce jour là mes amours mortes

E7                Am
En auront fini de mourir

The boxer
[Verse 1]

C                                       C/B    Am
I am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told

      G
I have squandered my resistance

     G7           G6               C
For a pocketful of mumbles such are promises

   C/B      Am           G                 F
All lies and jest still a man hears what he wants to hear

                  C      G    F G C
And disregards the rest



      C                                     C/B    Am
When I left my home and family I was no more than a boy

      G
In the company of strangers

      G7         G6              C
In the quiet of a railway station running scared

C/B    Am          G              F                                C
Laying low seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go

       G              F    G          C
Looking for the places only they would know

[Verse 2]

      C                                  C/B   Am
Asking only workmans wages I come looking for a job

            G
But I get no offers

      G7               G6                C
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue

 C/B  Am               G                F                               C
I do declare there were times when I was so lonesome I took some comfort there

Now the years are rolling by me, they are rocking evenly

        G
And I am older than I once was

   G7                G6               C
And younger than I'll be, that's not unusual

No, it isn't strange, after changes upon changes we are more or less the same

     G              F                C
After changes we are more or less the same

Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone

     G              G7            G6             C
Going home where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me

Em          Am
 Leading me-e

Going home



      C                                     C/B    Am
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade

      G
And he carries the reminders

  G7               G6               C
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down or cut him till he cried out

            C/B     Am
In his anger and his shame

     G             F                                 C

Suspicious Minds -Elvis Presley
G                        C
  We're caught in a trap;  I can't walk out

D               C               G
  because I love you too much,  baby.

G                    C
  Why can't you see,   what you're doing to me,

D                      C          D     C  Bm  D7
  when you don't believe a word I say?

 Em                  Bm          C              D       D7
     and we can't build our dreams, on Suspicious Minds.


 
[Verse 2]

G                              C
  So, if an old friend I know, drops by to say hello,

D                 C           G
  would I still see suspicion in your eyes?
