Never in my wildest dreams

                 C

Would I be loving you

                   Fmaj7

Never in my wildest dreams

                   G     G7

Would my dreams come true



               Dm

You're just too good to touch

        Am

I can't discuss it much

      Fmaj7

I get too choked up

                  G

Don't wanna make a scene

                      C

Never In My Wildest Dreams








[Verse 2]

                    Fmaj7

Never in my wildest dreams

                 C

Would I roam this land

                     Fmaj7

Sail across the seven seas

              G6  G7

I'm a hard luck man



                  Dsus2

But I know what my purpose is

                 Am

It's not on some pilgrimage

               Fmaj7

Its wherever my baby is

     G

My love supreme

                    C

Never In My Wildest Dreams









[Verse 3]

           Dsus2

Walk in the cold, cold wind

         Am

Carry my laundry bin

        Fmaj7

Take my tags for a spin

            G

Watch daytime TV



               Dsus2

You're just too good to touch

            Am

And I can't discuss it much

         Fmaj7

I get too choked up

                 G

Don't wanna make a scene

                    C
